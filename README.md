# kennytvs-epic-force-close-loading-screen-mod-for-fabric

Since 1.18.2, the client only quits the world loading screen once the chunk it is in has been received. This mod force closes that screen.

Credits to the well thought out name go to [mdcfe](https://github.com/mdcfe).

## Yeeting the screen *entirely*
If you want to **fully** kill the screen, you can toggle a config option (you need [modmenu](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/modmenu) and [Cloth Config API](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/cloth-config) for that).

Here are some video comparisons of Vanilla vs. the mod with the instant-close option enabled for world joining and world changing:
