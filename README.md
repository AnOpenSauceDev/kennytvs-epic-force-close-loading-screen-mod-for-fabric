# kennytvs-epic-force-close-loading-screen-mod-for-fabric

Since 1.18.2, the client only quits the world loading screen once the chunk it is in has been received. This mod force closes that screen.
If you want to **fully** kill the screen, you can toggle a config option (you need [modmenu](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/modmenu) and [Cloth Config API](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/cloth-config) for that).

Credits to the well thought out name go to [mdcfe](https://github.com/mdcfe).
