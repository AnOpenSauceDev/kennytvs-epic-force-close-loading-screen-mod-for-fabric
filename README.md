# kennytvs-epic-force-close-loading-screen-mod-for-fabric

Since 1.18.2, the client only quits the world loading screen once the chunk it is in has been received. This mod force closes that screen.

Credits to the well-thought-out name go to [mdcfe](https://github.com/mdcfe).
Credits to the awful icon go to myself.

## Yeeting the screen *entirely*
If you want to **fully** kill the screen, you can toggle a config option (you need [modmenu](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/modmenu) and [Cloth Config API](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/cloth-config) for that). **Keep in mind this reintroduces a client bug where you can briefly (only visually) fall through the world if your network connection is slow or the server is loading chunks very slowly after a world change.**

Here are some video comparisons of Vanilla vs. the mod with the instant-close option enabled:
